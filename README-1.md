# Bubbleverse HPC

**One question at a time. Reproducible execution. Evidence before model.**

Bubbleverse HPC is the public research-execution and reproducibility repository behind the Bubbleverse project.

Bubbleverse does not begin with a model that must be defended. It begins with a scientific question. When a question requires numerical work, this repository is where the computational experiment is defined, locked, executed, tested and preserved.

The scientific model that survives this process is maintained separately in [`Morfindien/bubbleverse-model`](https://github.com/Morfindien/bubbleverse-model).

## What this repository is

This repository is the execution side of Bubbleverse.

It contains the machinery used to turn a scientific question into a traceable computational result, including:

- GitHub Actions workflows
- scientific Python programs
- setup and environment scripts
- preregistrations
- source locks
- program registries
- validation tests
- execution notes and install manifests
- result-artifact contracts
- historical and superseded implementations

The repository intentionally preserves technical history. A newer workflow may supersede an older one without erasing the path that led to it.

This is therefore both an active research system and a reproducibility record.

---

## The basic workflow

A Bubbleverse computational question normally moves through a chain like this:

```text
Scientific question
        ↓
Preregistered test
        ↓
Locked sources / data / environment
        ↓
Registered PROGRAM_ID
        ↓
GitHub Actions execution
        ↓
Numerical result artifacts
        ↓
Validation and scientific gates
        ↓
Result / handoff
        ↓
Bubbleverse Model
```

The exact route depends on the question.

Not every question needs HPC, and not every numerical run produces a scientific result.

---

## Start system

The repository includes a central launcher for registered programs.

From GitHub:

1. Open **Actions**
2. Select **000 🚀 BUBBLEVERSE START — SEGMENTED V5**
3. Press **Run workflow**
4. Enter the exact `PROGRAM_ID`
5. Start the run

The launcher checks the registry before dispatching the scientific workflow.

It verifies, among other things:

- the `PROGRAM_ID` exists
- the program is active
- the Q identity is valid
- the target workflow is valid
- the expected result-artifact contract is defined

The launcher then dispatches the registered workflow and tracks the child execution.

The registry is the authoritative mapping between a program identifier and the workflow that is allowed to execute it.

---

## Program registry

The central registry is:

```text
bubbleverse_program_registry.json
```

A registered scientific program can define information such as:

```text
PROGRAM_ID
Q
workflow
scientific program
tests
preregistration
source lock
result ID
expected artifacts
status
version
supersession history
```

This makes the execution path explicit instead of relying on filenames or memory.

Programs may be marked, for example, as active, broken or superseded as the implementation evolves.

---

## Scientific locking

Bubbleverse HPC tries to separate scientific changes from technical repairs.

For demanding runs, the repository can preserve or lock:

- source versions
- external repository commits
- data definitions
- package versions
- execution commits
- priors and parameter definitions
- scientific acceptance criteria
- expected result artifacts

Where practical, later technical versions reuse an already validated scientific setup rather than silently changing the experiment.

A technical repair should not become a scientific change by accident.

---

## Preregistration

Many workflows include a preregistration file before the numerical result exists.

Typical files follow patterns such as:

```text
q###_*_preregister_*.json
```

A preregistration can define the test surface, comparison rules, acceptance thresholds, allowed branches of the analysis and other scientific decisions that should not be rewritten after seeing the outcome.

This is used to reduce result-driven rule changes.

---

## Source locks and provenance

Scientific programs can also carry source-lock files such as:

```text
q###_*_source_lock_*.json
```

These record the external scientific state required by the run.

Depending on the experiment, this may include exact commits, datasets, numerical packages or previously validated Bubbleverse results.

Runtime setup can additionally record hashes and provenance for installed or downloaded scientific inputs before the main calculation begins.

The goal is simple:

> A result should remain connected to the exact scientific inputs that produced it.

---

## Tests and gates

The repository contains question-specific validation code as well as workflow-level gates.

These can test things such as:

- registry consistency
- preregistration consistency
- source-lock identity
- valid numerical inputs
- finite likelihoods
- expected parameter support
- convergence
- artifact completeness
- scientific classification rules
- reproducibility contracts

A workflow reaching the end of GitHub Actions is not, by itself, proof that a scientific result exists.

Technical success and scientific success are deliberately treated as different things.

---

## Long-running computation

Some Bubbleverse questions are small.

Others are not.

Long numerical campaigns can use:

- matrix execution
- parallel independent chains
- cached scientific environments
- checkpointed or resumable state
- segmented runs
- bounded runtime per segment
- continuation decisions
- final convergence gates

For example, current portability workflows can split independent posterior chains into bounded compute segments, preserve resumable state and continue until the preregistered completion criteria are reached or the allowed execution boundary is exhausted.

This is designed to make long calculations survive the practical limits of hosted CI infrastructure without pretending an incomplete chain is a finished result.

---

## Artifacts are part of the record

Bubbleverse workflows use named GitHub Actions artifacts as part of the scientific handoff.

Artifacts may contain:

- static validation results
- environment provenance
- numerical chains
- endpoint results
- test outputs
- run manifests
- preregistration copies
- source-lock copies
- final classifications
- handoff material

The expected artifact set can be registered before execution.

Missing required artifacts can therefore be treated as a failed execution contract rather than silently ignored.

---

## Failure is preserved

Bubbleverse does not require every program version to succeed.

The repository contains technical failures, superseded attempts and repaired implementations because they are part of the development and scientific audit trail.

A failed version may reveal:

- non-convergence
- an invalid environment
- an artifact-contract failure
- a numerical instability
- an implementation error
- a scientific incompatibility

Where a later version repairs a technical problem, the earlier failure can remain documented instead of being rewritten out of history.

Negative and failed results are information.

---

## Current cosmology work

The repository currently contains a substantial cosmology execution chain, including work on:

- Hubble-constant inference
- Early Dark Energy
- likelihood attribution
- optimizer/globality tests
- Planck likelihood implementations
- CamSpec / HiLLiPoP comparisons
- ACT information
- BAO information
- robustness and portability tests

One example is the Q041 downstream portability campaign, which tests whether a validated CamSpec–HiLLiPoP geometry difference in an n=3 EDE analysis remains scientifically consequential after adding matched external CMB, lensing and BAO information.

The individual scientific conclusions should be taken from their completed result artifacts and the accepted Bubbleverse model — not inferred from the existence of a workflow alone.

---

## Repository map

The repository is intentionally execution-oriented rather than arranged like a conventional software library.

Important areas and filename families include:

```text
.github/workflows/
    GitHub Actions launchers and question-specific execution workflows

bubbleverse_program_registry.json
    Central program-to-workflow registry

q###_*.py
    Scientific programs, analysis code and validation tests

q###_*.sh
    Environment preparation and execution setup

q###_*_preregister_*.json
    Preregistered scientific rules

q###_*_source_lock_*.json
    Locked scientific sources and external dependencies

*_INSTALL.txt
*_manifest.txt
*_NOTE.txt
    Installation, repair, execution and provenance notes
```

Because Bubbleverse preserves the research path, multiple versions of a program can coexist.

The registry and status fields determine which version is authoritative for execution.

## Relationship to Bubbleverse Model

Bubbleverse uses two public repositories with different jobs.

### Bubbleverse HPC

Repository:

[`Morfindien/Bubbleverse`](https://github.com/Morfindien/Bubbleverse)

Purpose:

**Execute, test and preserve scientific computations.**

This is where numerical experiments, workflows, source locks, preregistrations, artifacts and execution history live.

### Bubbleverse Model

Repository:

[`Morfindien/bubbleverse-model`](https://github.com/Morfindien/bubbleverse-model)

Purpose:

**Maintain the version-controlled scientific model state produced from validated Bubbleverse evidence.**

It contains accepted and candidate model states, formalization, tests, provenance, releases and version history.

In short:

```text
Bubbleverse HPC  →  asks and computes
Bubbleverse Model →  retains what survives
```

---

## Scientific philosophy

Bubbleverse is not designed to prove Bubbleverse.

It is not designed to defend standard cosmology.

It is not designed to reject standard cosmology.

The working rule is:

> **Reality has priority over the model.**

If a Bubbleverse idea fails, it should fail.

If an established result survives testing, it should survive.

If the evidence is insufficient, **unknown** is a valid scientific outcome.

The purpose of computation is not to manufacture certainty.

It is to make uncertainty, assumptions, failures and surviving results more explicit.

---

## Reproducibility notice

This repository is an active research environment, not a stable general-purpose software package.

Historical workflows may depend on:

- specific GitHub Actions behavior
- exact external commits
- cached environments
- external scientific datasets
- artifacts from earlier Bubbleverse runs
- version-specific numerical software

The existence of source code does not guarantee that every historical workflow can be rerun indefinitely without reconstructing its original environment.

Where the project has locked enough provenance to reconstruct that environment, those locks should be preferred over replacing dependencies with newer versions.

---

## Public use

The repository is public so the computational side of Bubbleverse can be inspected.

You are welcome to:

- read the code
- inspect workflows
- examine preregistrations and source locks
- follow the execution history
- fork the repository
- reproduce or independently challenge results

A fork or third-party modification is not an official Bubbleverse result unless it is incorporated into the authoritative Bubbleverse process.
